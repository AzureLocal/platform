# Project Management

This page is the AzureLocal overlay for the HCS
[project-management standard](https://platform.hybridsolutions.cloud/standards/project-management/).
Only AzureLocal-specific differences are defined here.

## Authoritative source

GitHub Issues and the AzureLocal organization Project are the primary intake and work-tracking
surfaces. Issues may synchronize into HCS Azure DevOps under the existing split-source rules, but
operators author and update GitHub-native issue data in GitHub.

The reusable PMO board is a read-only snapshot of those issues. It MUST NOT store browser edits or
write changes back to GitHub. Every displayed item links to its authoritative issue.

## Scope selection

AzureLocal uses the per-repository project model unless `registry.yaml` explicitly assigns a
shared project. A board SHOULD represent one repository. A cross-repository portfolio board MAY
use the organization Project when its configuration names that scope explicitly.

## Publication

Generated snapshots stay under ignored `.artifacts/pmo/`. Scheduled automation publishes an
authenticated workflow artifact. Claude or Codex publication remains owner-only or
workspace-restricted unless the repository owner explicitly approves public access.

[work-item sync standard](https://platform.hybridsolutions.cloud/standards/work-item-sync/).
